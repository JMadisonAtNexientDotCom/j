Using dummies to carve up boiler plateHTML into sections
sounded like a great idea.

But then I remember what an old boss said..
"Don't just do things to save lines of code"

He was talking about how optimizations sometimes make the code harder
to read. Sure, including the headers all the time will take up more memory.
However:

1. We want the .JSP pages to be pretty much identical to the .HTML
pages our UI people make. Except with some special tags integrated
into it to make the front-end and back end agree.

Will be trying another test page using this concept.
