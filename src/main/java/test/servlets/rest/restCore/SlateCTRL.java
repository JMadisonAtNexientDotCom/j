/**
 * Controller for operations involving a SLATE.
 * A slate is what the ninja uses as an answer sheet for a single question
 * asked of them. The slate contains the original question being asked on
 * the top of it (a cuecard reference) and then some lines of chalk detailing
 * what the ninja thinks are the answers.
 * 
 * (Chalk is basically a Rhyme ID (answer ID) )
