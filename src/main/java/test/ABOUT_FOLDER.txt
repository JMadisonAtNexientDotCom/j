NOTE:
This folder should really be named "app", not "test"
However, refactoring to "app" totally destroyed my entire application.
All pages were returning BLANK!!!

I don't know why this is. I am glad I caught it the day I did the refactor.
Also, I was stupid to have done such a big refactor and then NOT test to make
sure everything was still up.

I assumed that since the BUILD was not broken, that the actual site
was working. This was not the case.

This folder eventually needs a better name than "test".
But be very careful as you attempt to refactor this folder.
