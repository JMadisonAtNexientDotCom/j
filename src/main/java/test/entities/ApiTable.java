 * This is a table designed to store all REST web-service api URLS.
 * Reasoning: Hard coding the API urls into our HTML pages will be a refactoring
 *            nightmare. Rather than do that, we should dynamically build
 *            all of the urls relative to: <hostRoot>/api/
 *            <hostRoot>/api/Dynamically/Generate/Path/To/API
