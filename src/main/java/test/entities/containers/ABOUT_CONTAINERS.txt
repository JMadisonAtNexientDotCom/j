Containers simply wrap other entity objects.
The original reason was so that functions who's job it is to find
and return an entity do not return NULL when no entity is found.

Instead they return a container.
And that container's
.exist == false
.entity== null
When no entity was found.

I like to use .has variables to verify that a value should indeed be null
when a value slot is allowed to be null.
