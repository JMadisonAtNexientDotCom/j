Composites are entities that are made by compositing other entities
together. An example is a riddle on a riddle-exam.

They have no direct representation in the database.

THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY META-DATA!!!
All of the properties within the composite must be references
to actual [entities/tables].

Entities like this will make JSON responses that are used on
our .html test pages easier.

.HTML pages will eventually need to be .jsp.
But one step at a time!
