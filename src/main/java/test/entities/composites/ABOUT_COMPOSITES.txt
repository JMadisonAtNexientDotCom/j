Composites are entities that are made by compositing other entities
togther. An example is a riddle on a riddle-exam.

They have no direct representation in the database.

Entities like this will make JSON responses that are used on
our .html test pages easier.

.HTML pages will eventually need to be .jsp.
But one step at a time!
