A folder that contains any data that is:
1. An abstraction of a database. Like entities.
2. Used for communication, where values inside the class
   represent values that are in the database.

   Example: LecternSlab represents a Ninja's written response to a CueCard
            that the Jester has read from.

   LecternSlab ~= a candidate response to a question. That needs to be
                  sent back to server side.

   CueCard ~= A combination of Riddle (question) and Rhymes 
		(Possible answers to select from) 
		that have been sent from server to client.

   Jester: No real code object for this. For now it is just an
           elaborative encoding object within our story that will
           help us remember the different parts of this system.
