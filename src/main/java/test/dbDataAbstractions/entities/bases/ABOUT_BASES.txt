These are base classes for different entity categories:

//WHAT?
These categories are mainly to help organization and understanding
of the code. They don't actually offer any functionality.
Except for enforcing stricter typing.

//WHY?
Why would you artificially enforce stricter typing than needed?
The more strict you are, the less errors you have. And this artificial
typing construct creates a strictness that will help catch the hardest
to find errors... DESIGN errors.

//DETAILS:

BUNDLE TYPE ENTITY:
Contains references to multiple entity types in it.

COMPOSITE/COLLECTION type ENTITY:
Contains multiple entities of the same TYPE.

BASE ENTITY:
The base entity from which all other entities derive.
