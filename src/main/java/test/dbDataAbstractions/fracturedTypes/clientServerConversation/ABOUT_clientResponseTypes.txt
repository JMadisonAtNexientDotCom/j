Client response types are FRACTURED types
because they represent a sub-set of information in the database.

Example:
An array of only rhyme IDs (question ids) that notifies us what
answers the ninja (candidate) has used to reply to the question.

Fractured could also be seen as meaning "sub-set" or "sub selection"
in this case.
