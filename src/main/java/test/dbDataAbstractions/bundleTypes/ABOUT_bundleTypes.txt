Bundle types are data types that are containers 
that hold mixed types of dbDataAbstractions types.

They are primarily for:
1. Creating a nicely made bundle that will help with sending 
   responses back and forth from server to client and back.

2. A catch-all category for gluing different types together where
   we are not sure what other category it all fits under.
