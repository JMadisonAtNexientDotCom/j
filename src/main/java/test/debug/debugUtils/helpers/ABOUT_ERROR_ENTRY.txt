So... You would think that these would all extend from
ErrorEntry... But not the case.

What I have done here seems like an anti-pattern...
A lot of cut+pasted code...

However... All of the error checks and messages are working....
But this got a bit sloppy...

I didn't expect to write over 1,000 lines of error checking code
today. But what I did was pretty cool.

The source code analyses itself and looks to see if it is
breaking any rules for how my entity classes should be put
together. This will either help me greatly, or end up being
a huge pain in my ass in the future.
