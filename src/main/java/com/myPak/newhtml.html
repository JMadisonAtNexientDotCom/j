        <div>Note to self: You can add new .html files.
             But if you add new .java files, you will need to RESTART
             the application before the application will work again.
             The app won't completely crash if you don't. But you'll be
             met with a page that notifies you the app is "down for maintenance"
             If you do not restart.
             
             Errors in code could also cause this to happen. So... Tread carefully.
