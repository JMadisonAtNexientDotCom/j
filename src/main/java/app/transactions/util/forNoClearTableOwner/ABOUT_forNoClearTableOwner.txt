This folder is for transaction utilites that have no clear table owner.
For example: 

A transaction function involving equally the admin_table and token_table
cannot belong in either the AdminTransUtil or the TokenTransUtil
since both tables can claim ownership to the function.

Do we call the new utility:
TokenAdminTransUtil?
Or
AdminTokenTransUtil?

For convention, I think that should be solved ALPHABETICALLY.

Also, organization in "forNoClearTableOwner" should be FLAT.
So that we can quickly see that the combined naming convention is
being followed.

I have broken that with riddleRhyme folder because it existed before
this restructure. But try to make the future commits fit this design.
