Fractured types can be though of as fractured entities.
They are types that contain information pertaining to database tables.
But they contain a fraction of it.

For example: If the type is just a list of Id's from a given table...
It is fractured.

You could achieve similiar non-fractured collection by havinga collection of
entities... But sometimes you might want something more light weight.
