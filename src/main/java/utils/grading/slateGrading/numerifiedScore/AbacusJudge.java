 * AbacusJudge reviews the abacuses that Mr. ClerkSlater 
 * assembled for the judge. AbacusJudge will take the raw stats
 * from the Abacuses and give us a single number.

 * Judges are more black/white in the way they think.
 * Hence why the judge character is condensing all of the information
 * into a single number. While the clerk (accountant type who works for the judge)
 * is synthesizing more complex stats from the Ninja's Slates.
